Q. How do we remove the need for Staff Login into the survey App, at the same time minimize the amount of typing required on the tablet device.
    For repeat clients, staff may only need to edit small amounts(if any) of text(typed) information, as we are preloading it from previous assessments.
    So the main typing (small, but multiple fields) is Firstname, Lastname, DOB (not really..picker)


- when network connection is there download data of ALL clients (for their team) and store in indexDB
- survey starts by identifying the clients - 
   - CCARE/MCARE Client ID  
   - DOB of client

   This combination of values is only known to the staff. i.e. if the tablet is in possesion of anyone else,
   they are unable to see other client's data (unless they do a bruteforce search.)
